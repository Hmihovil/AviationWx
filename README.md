# Summary

Android app to view data found on [aviationweather.gov](http://aviationweather.gov/)
 in a more friendly
fashion than trying to view the website directly on a mobile browser.

## Getting started

TODO

Once app is up and running, a long tap will query METARs for what's shown on screen.


## Desired Features

I'd love help making this app better.  Here's the things I have in mind.

* Make available on play store.
* Make sure another developer can get up and running (have I included essential files in git?)
* About tab to steer folks to github
* Be smart about which stations to display
* Use phone's position to center map
* Wind barbs
* TAF
* PIREPs
* Radar overlay
