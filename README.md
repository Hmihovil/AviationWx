# Summary

Android app to view data found on [aviationweather.gov](http://aviationweather.gov/)
 in a more friendly
fashion than trying to view the website directly on a mobile browser.

## Getting started

Available on Google Play Store here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clearboxsoln.aviationwx](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clearboxsoln.aviationwx)

Once app is up and running, a long tap will query METARs for what's shown on screen.


## Desired Features

I'd love help making this app better.  Here's the things I have in mind.

* Make sure another developer can get up and running (have I included essential files in git?)
* About tab to steer folks to github
* Radar overlay
* Be smart about which stations to display. (I think this is done with the density=prior)
* Ability to switch to satellite or terrain google map views
* Use phone's position to center map. (Done -- but first callback from request doesn't seem to work quite right.)
* Wind barbs - Could be implemented with features built into aviationweather.gov
* TAF (DONE)
* PIREPs - (DONE - but icon could be much better)
